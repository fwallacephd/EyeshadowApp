# Eyeshadow Color Picker
Choose the right eyeshadow colors and show your Harry Potter house spirit!
That's right, the color combinations are based on the four houses at Hogwarts. 
More eyeshadow combinations are forthcoming.

To use the Color Picker, go to the website https://fwallacephd.github.io/EyeshadowApp/ 
and select your choice of color combination from the following four buttons

*Ravenclaw Blue (my personal favorite)
*Slytherin Green
*Gryffindor Scarlett
*Hufflepuff Gold

Once you select your button, a list of eyeshadow brands and color are listed and 
corresponds with the eyeshadow diagram. 

This application was created with standard HTML, CSS, and JS.
I also used Bootstrap to ensure mobile responsiveness.
